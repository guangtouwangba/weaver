      "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and learn patterns from it.",
      "contexts": [
        "Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.",
        "Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.",

      "question": "How does deep learning differ from traditional machine learning?",
      "answer": "Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. Unlike traditional machine learning which requires manual feature engineering, deep learning can automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.",
      "contexts": [
        "Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.",
        "Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.",

      "question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled data where the correct output is known, training the model to predict outcomes. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns and structures without predefined labels.",
      "contexts": [

      "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
      "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. The model becomes too complex and fails to generalize.",
      "contexts": [
        "Overfitting is a modeling error that occurs when a function is too closely fit to a limited set of data points.",

      "ground_truth": "Overfitting is a phenomenon where a machine learning model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data because it has learned the noise and specific details of the training set rather than general patterns.",
