# Rag Core Package

Holds the reusable building blocks of the knowledge RAG platform: ingest workflows, retrieval pipelines, graph orchestration, preprocessing, routing, and observability modules.

Current modules were migrated from the initial skeleton (`chains`, `graphs`, `services`). Additional subpackages are scaffolded for future expansion (preprocessing, query transformation, memory, evaluation, etc.).
