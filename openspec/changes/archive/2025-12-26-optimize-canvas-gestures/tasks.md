## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Refactor `handleWheel` in `KonvaCanvas.tsx` to distinguish between zoom and pan intents
- [x] 1.2 Implement panning logic using `deltaX` and `deltaY` when `ctrlKey` is false
- [x] 1.3 Restrict zoom logic to execute only when `ctrlKey` is true (Pinch)
- [x] 1.4 Verify sensitivity/speed for both panning and zooming to ensure smooth UX
