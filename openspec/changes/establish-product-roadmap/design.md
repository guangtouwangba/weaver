# Design: Product Roadmap 2025

## SISP Analysis (Self-Correction)
*   *Old Pitfall*: "Look, our AI works while you sleep!" (Who cares? Maybe I don't want it to.)
*   *New Focus*: "Get me to the 'Aha!' moment before I burn out."

## Phasing Strategy: The "Unblocking" Evolution

### Phase 1: Unblock **Reading** (The "Instant Briefing" Tool)
*   **The Pain**: "TL;DR." I have 20 tabs open. I physically cannot read them all.
*   **The Fix**: **One-Click Synthesis**.
    *   *Feature*: **Chrome Extension** that doesn't just "Save"—it **"Reads"**. You click it, and it tells you: "This article claims X, which contradicts your project's premise Y."
    *   *Value*: Turns 20 minutes of reading into 30 seconds of assessing.

### Phase 2: Unblock **Hunting** (The "Missing Link" Finder)
*   **The Pain**: "Dead Ends." I found a fact, but I don't know if it's true, or I'm missing the source. I spend 2 hours falling down rabbit holes.
*   **The Fix**: **Automated Due Diligence**.
    *   *Feature*: Select a claim -> Click **"Verify"**. The Agent checks 10 sources and returns a "True/False/Nuanced" verdict with links.
    *   *Value*: Turns 2 hours of Googling into 1 click.

### Phase 3: Unblock **Writing** (The "Blank Page" Killer)
*   **The Pain**: "Synthesis Paralysis." I have all the notes, but I don't know how to structure the report.
*   **The Fix**: **Structured Drafting**.
    *   *Feature*: **"Draft from Graph"**. The system looks at your clusters and proposes: "It looks like you have 3 main arguments. Shall I generate an outline?"
    *   *Value*: Turns 4 hours of staring at a blank screen into 1 hour of editing.
