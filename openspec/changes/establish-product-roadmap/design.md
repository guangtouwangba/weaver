# Design: Product Roadmap 2025

## Competitive Analysis & "Why Me?"
The Knowledge Tool market is crowded (NotebookLM, YouMind, Heptabase). We win by solving the **"Closed World"** and **"Passive Tool"** problems.

### The Landscape
*   **NotebookLM (Google)**: Best for **Consumption**. "Chat with *your* docs." Excellent for verifying facts in uploaded PDFs. *Limitation*: Cannot find new information; purely reactive.
*   **YouMind**: Best for **Creation**. "Turn bookmarks into posts." Good linear workflow. *Limitation*: Focuses on content output, not deep problem solving.

### Our Thesis: "The Agentic Workbench"
We are not building a "Knowledge Base" or a "Chatbot". We are building a **Co-Thinking Partner** that acts with agency.
1.  **Breaking the "Closed World"**: Unlike NotebookLM, we don't just answer from your files. If the answer is missing, our **Deep Research Agent** goes to the web, finds the missing puzzle piece, and adds it to the board.
    *   *Feature*: "Deep Think" button is not a chat—it's a mission dispatcher.
2.  **Active Sensemaking**: Unlike YouMind's static mind maps, our **Canvas** is a shared workspace. The AI doesn't just "generate" a map; it *works* on it. It groups similar notes, draws connection lines, and flags contradictions in real-time.
    *   *Feature*: "Auto-Cluster" and "Suggest Link" interactions.

## Phasing Strategy (Value-Driven)

### Phase 1: The "Research Assistant" (Capture & Triage)
*   **Goal**: Solve Fragmentation. "Capture Everything, Miss Nothing."
*   **Differentiation**:
    *   **Agentic Triage**: We don't just save the URL. We auto-extract entities (People, Companies) to populate the Graph immediately.

### Phase 2: The "Thinking Partner" (Connect & Visualize)
*   **Goal**: Solve Complexity. "See the Unseen Patterns."
*   **Differentiation**:
    *   **Deep Research**: The ability to *expand* the knowledge graph autonomously. "I see you have 3 papers on Transformers. I found 2 newer ones that contradict paper #1. Shall I add them?"
    *   **Spatial Reasoning**: AI operations happen on the Canvas (Visually), not in a hidden chat window.

### Phase 3: The "Content Studio" (Synthesize & Publish)
*   **Goal**: Solve Production Bottlenecks. "Turn Thoughts into Deliverables."
*   **Differentiation**:
    *   **Grounded Synthesis**: Writing is backed by specific nodes on the canvas. Clicking a sentence in the draft highlights the source node on the board (bi-directional linking).
