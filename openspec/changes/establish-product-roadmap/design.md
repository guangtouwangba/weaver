# Design: Product Roadmap 2025

## Competitive DNA Analysis
To survive, we must build what they *cannot* build due to their structural DNA.

### 1. The "Session" Trap (NotebookLM / Perplexity)
*   **Their DNA**: "Chat". Ephemeral.
*   **Our Moat**: **Persistence**.

### 2. The "Editor" Trap (YouMind / Notion)
*   **Their DNA**: "Document". Passive.
*   **Our Moat**: **Agency**.

## Phasing Strategy: The "Analyst" Evolution

### Phase 1: The "Research Assistant" (Capture & Triage)
*   **Value**: "Don't just File it; Process it."
*   **Critical Feature**: **Entity Resolution Layer**.

### Phase 2: The "Thinking Partner" (Connect & Visualize)
*   **Value**: "Work While I Sleep."
*   **Critical Feature**: **Asynchronous Graph Maintenance**.
    *   *Step 1 (Connect)*: "I connect Cluster A and Cluster B."
    *   *Step 2 (The Loop - NEW)*: **"The Curiosity Engine"**.
        *   "I see a contradiction between A and B."
        *   **Action**: "I will autonomously dispatch a 'Tie-Breaker' agent to find a 3rd source to resolve this conflict."
        *   **Result**: The graph *heals* itself. It doesn't just flag problems; it tries to solve them.

### Phase 3: The "Content Studio" (Synthesize & Publish)
*   **Value**: "Living Reports."
*   **Critical Feature**: **Dynamic Synthesis**.
