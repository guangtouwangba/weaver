# Design: Product Roadmap 2025

## Product Philosophy: The "Sensemaking Loop"
Code development will follow the user's actual workflow. We build the "In" door first, then the "Work" room, then the "Out" door.

## Phasing Strategy

### Phase 1: The "Research Assistant" (Capture & Triage)
*   **User Story**: "As a researcher, I want to dump everything I find into one place and have it organized for me, so I don't lose context."
*   **Core Workflow**:
    1.  **Capture**: User browse web/PDFs -> One-click save via **Chrome Extension**.
    2.  **Enrich**: System auto-tags, summarizes, and extracts entities (Backend RAG).
    3.  **Triage**: User reviews `Inbox`, archiving noise and assigning signal to `Projects`.
*   **Key Deliverable**: A "Smart Inbox" that feels like an AI research assistant.

### Phase 2: The "Thinking Partner" (Connect & Visualize)
*   **User Story**: "As an analyst, I want to see how these 50 documents relate to each other so I can find the story."
*   **Core Workflow**:
    1.  **Spatial Organization**: Drag items from Inbox to **Canvas**. Group related facts.
    2.  **Deep Research**: Trigger "Deep Think" on a cluster. Agent browses the web to fill missing gaps.
    3.  **Pattern Recognition**: Switch to **Graph View** to see hidden connections between entities.
*   **Key Deliverable**: A coherent "Knowledge Graph" and "Canvas" that acts as an external brain.

### Phase 3: The "Content Studio" (Synthesize & Publish)
*   **User Story**: "As a creator, I want to turn my research board into a structured report or script without starting from a blank page."
*   **Core Workflow**:
    1.  **Drafting**: **Writer Mode** generates an outline from the Canvas state.
    2.  **Refining**: User edits the draft while AI provides citations from the source material.
    3.  **Consumption**: **Podcast Mode** converts the report into an audio briefing for on-the-go review.
*   **Key Deliverable**: High-quality artifacts (Reports, Slides, Audio).
