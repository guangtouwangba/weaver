# Establish Product Roadmap 2025

## Goal Description
Formalize the product roadmap to transition `research-agent-rag` from a prototype (`web` directory) to a production-ready application (`app/frontend` + `app/backend`). This roadmap prioritizes code consolidation, feature parity, and preparing for ecosystem expansion.

## Impact Analysis
- **Codebase**: Consolidates frontend code into `app/frontend`, removing the deprecated `web` directory.
- **Features**: Ensures `Studio` (Canvas, Graph, Writer) features are fully migrated and integrated with the Backend API.
- **Infrastructure**: Sets the stage for authentic integrations (Supabase) and external tools (Chrome Extension).
