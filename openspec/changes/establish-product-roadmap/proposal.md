# Establish Product Roadmap 2025

## Goal Description
Establish a product roadmap that defines a defensible strategic moat based on **Proactive Agency**. We are moving beyond "AI Features" (which are commodities) to a "System of Intelligence" where the AI acts as a persistent, asynchronous researcher—a fundamental shift that "Job-to-be-Done" tools (like editors or archivers) cannot easily copy without destroying their existing UX.

## The Strategic Moat: "The Junior Analyst" (Why they can't copy us)
*   **NotebookLM** cannot pivot here because they are optimized for **Veracity & Safety**. Their brand promise is "Grounded in *Your* Docs". Introducing autonomous web agents that introduce *new, unverified* information breaks their core trust model.
*   **YouMind/Notion** cannot pivot here because they are optimized for **Human Authorship**. Their unified state is "The Document". To make AI a pro-active co-author that works while you sleep requires re-architecting their entire CRDT/Sync engine to support "Agentic State", not just "Text State".

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The roadmap now focuses on features that enable **Long-Horizon Asynchronous Work** (Agents that remember and work over time), rather than real-time "Copilot" features.
