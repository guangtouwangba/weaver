# Establish Product Roadmap 2025

## Goal Description
Avoid the "Solution In Search of a Problem" (SISP) trap. Instead of building "cool AI agents," we focus on solving the **"10-Hour Research Slog."**

## The "Hair on Fire" Problem
Knowledge workers are not just "searching"; they are "weighing evidence." The pain isn't finding 10 links; it's figuring out which one is true.

## Strategic Adjustment: The "Curiosity Loop"
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A graph that just "connects" is static. A closed loop requires **Feedback**.
> **The Loop**: Data -> Conflict -> **New Question** -> New Data -> Resolution.
> The product must not just "manage" knowledge; it must **active seek** to resolve gaps in that knowledge.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> Roadmap now includes **"Autonomous Resolution"** (The Tie-Breaker Agent) as the key mechanism to close the loop in Phase 2.
