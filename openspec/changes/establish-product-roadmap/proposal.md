# Establish Product Roadmap 2025

## Goal Description
Avoid the "Solution In Search of a Problem" (SISP) trap. Instead of building "cool AI agents," we focus on solving the **"10-Hour Research Slog."** The goal is to reduce the time-to-insight for knowledge workers who currently spend 80% of their time just *gathering* and *formatting* data, leaving only 20% for thinking.

## The "Hair on Fire" Problem
Knowledge workers (Analysts, Researchers, Creators) are drowning, not just "fragmented."
*   **The Pain**: "I have to read 100 tabs and 5 PDFs to write ONE email."
*   **The Cost**: It takes 3 days to produce a briefing that should take 3 hours.
*   **The Solution (Hidden)**: It's not "Agents"—it's **"Compression"**. We compress the time between "Curiosity" and "Understanding."

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The roadmap has been renamed to focus on **Outcomes** (e.g., "Instant Briefing") rather than **Mechanisms** (e.g., "Deep Research"). Use Agency only as a means to an end.
