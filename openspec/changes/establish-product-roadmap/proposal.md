# Establish Product Roadmap 2025

## Goal Description
Formalize the product roadmap for the production application (`app/frontend` + `app/backend`). This roadmap prioritizes the development of the core "Studio" experience, intelligent research workflows, and preparing for multi-user/production deployment.

## Impact Analysis
- **Features**: Focuses on implementing the `Studio` (Canvas, Graph, Synthesis) from the ground up in the production stack.
- **Workflow**: Completes the end-to-end user journey: "Collect (Inbox) -> Analyze (Studio) -> Synthesize (Writer/Podcast)".
- **Infrastructure**: Prepares for robust integrations including Chrome Extensions, Deep Research agents, and Supabase Auth.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The roadmap now treats the `web` directory as a prototype and is not a migration path. It assumes Greenfield development in `app/frontend` for all upcoming modules.
