# Establish Product Roadmap 2025

## Goal Description
Establish a value-driven product roadmap that aligns development with the core user journey: **From Information Overload to Structured Insight**. This roadmap prioritizes features that deliver tangible business value at each stage of the research workflow.

## Business Value Analysis
The product addresses three critical pain points in knowledge work:
1.  **Fragmentation**: Information is scattered across tabs, PDFs, and notes. -> **Value: Unified Ingestion**.
2.  **Complexity**: Connecting dots across massive datasets is cognitively exhausting. -> **Value: AI-Augmented Sensemaking**.
3.  **Production Bottleneck**: Transforming research into deliverables (reports, content) is slow. -> **Value: Assisted Synthesis**.

## User Guidelines
> [!TIP]
> Each phase corresponds to a distinct "Job to be Done" for the user. We only move to the next phase when the current loop is frictionless.
