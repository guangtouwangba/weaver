# Research Agent RAG - Product Roadmap 2025

> **Product Philosophy**: "Deep Research" is a commodity. **"Deep Understanding"** is the asset.
> **The Promise**: Don't just *find* the answer. *Keep* the answer and build on it.

## Strategic Differentiators (Revised)
1.  **State vs. Session**: We are the "Hard Drive" for intelligence.
2.  **The "Curiosity Loop"**: We don't just *answer* questions. We *generate* new questions to resolve contradictions in your data.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Phases (The Feedback Loop)

### Phase 1: Ingestion (Data -> Nodes)
**Goal**: "Capture & Structure"
- [x] **URL Content Extraction**: Import content from web pages, YouTube, Bilibili, and Douyin via URLs.
- [ ] **Unified Ingestion**: Chrome Extension + Entity Resolution.

### Phase 2: Sensemaking (Nodes -> Graph)
**Goal**: "Connect & Conflict"
- [ ] **Auto-Cluster**: Group related concepts.
- [ ] **The "Curiosity Engine" (The Loop)**:
    - [ ] **Dissonance Detector**: "Node A says X, Node B says Y. This is a conflict."
    - [ ] **Autonomous Tie-Breaker**: System triggers a *new* web search specifically to resolve the conflict.
    - [ ] **Synthesized Truth**: System updates the graph with a "Resolution Node" explaining the nuance.
    *   *Result*: The Graph gets smarter over time without you.

### Phase 3: Production (Graph -> Artifact)
**Goal**: "Graph -> Draft"
- [ ] **Contextual Writer**: Draft content based on the *Resolved* Graph.
