# Research Agent RAG - Product Roadmap 2025

> **Product Philosophy**: "Deep Research" is a commodity. **"Deep Understanding"** is the asset.
> **The Promise**: Don't just *find* the answer. *Keep* the answer and build on it.

## Strategic Differentiators (Revised)
1.  **State vs. Session (The "Amnesia" Moat)**
    *   **Competitors (OpenAI / Perplexity)**: They are brilliant at *fetching* information, but they have "Session Amnesia". Once you close the tab, the mental model is gone.
    *   **Us**: We are **Persistence-First**. The value isn't the search; it's the **Graph** that remains after the search. We turn "Search Results" into "Knowledge Assets".

2.  **Async Agency (The "Night Shift" Moat)**
    *   **Competitors**: Reactive. They wait for you to prompt.
    *   **Us**: **Proactive**. Our agents wake up when sources change. If a new paper drops that contradicts your thesis, the Graph updates itself.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Phases (Pain-Driven)

### Phase 1: The "Reading Unblocker" (Stop Drowning)
**Pain Point**: "I have too many tabs and zero time."
**Solution**: **Instant Context**, not just storage.

- [ ] **Active Capture Extension**:
    - [ ] **"The Executive Summary"**: When capturing a page, instantly generate a 3-bullet summary relative to the *current project*. (e.g. "This argues against your thesis on X").
    - [ ] **Entity Tagger**: Auto-extract "Who/What/When" so I don't have to organize it manually.
- [ ] **Smart Inbox**:
    - [ ] **"The Daily Brief"**: A morning summary of everything captured yesterday, grouped by topic.

### Phase 2: The "Rabbit Hole Unblocker" (Stop Searching)
**Pain Point**: "I spend hours verifying facts and finding sources."
**Solution**: **Automated Grunt Work**.

- [ ] **Targeted Research Ops**:
    - [ ] **"Fact Check This"**: Select text -> AI validates against the open web.
    - [ ] **"Fill the Gap"**: "I'm missing data on Q3 revenue." -> AI finds it and adds a node.
- [ ] **Visual Clarity**:
    - [ ] **"Noise Filter"**: One-click to hide all "Generic/Repeated" info on the canvas, leaving only novel insights.

### Phase 3: The "Writing Unblocker" (Stop Stalling)
**Pain Point**: "I can't turn this mess of notes into a report."
**Solution**: **The 'Rough Draft' Machine**.

- [ ] **Contextual Writer**:
    - [ ] **"Argument Builder"**: Convert a cluster of nodes into a structured paragraph with citations.
    - [ ] **"Devil's Advocate"**: AI reviews your draft and comments: "You missed this counter-argument from Source B."
