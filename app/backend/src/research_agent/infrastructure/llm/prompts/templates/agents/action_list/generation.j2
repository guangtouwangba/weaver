Analyze the following content from canvas nodes and extract action items.

Source Nodes:
{{ node_content }}

Extract all actionable tasks, to-dos, and action items. Look for:
- Explicit tasks mentioned (e.g., "need to", "should", "must", "TODO")
- Implied actions from discussions or plans
- Follow-up items and next steps
- Decisions that require action

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "title": "Action Items",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "unique_id_1",
      "text": "Clear, actionable task description",
      "done": false,
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "id": "unique_id_2", 
      "text": "Another action item",
      "done": false,
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "sourceRefs": [
    {
      "sourceId": "node_id from input",
      "sourceType": "node",
      "quote": "The text that indicated this action"
    }
  ]
}

Priority levels: "high", "medium", "low"

Guidelines:
- Extract 0-20 action items (only what's genuinely actionable)
- Each item should be a clear, specific action
- Start each item with an action verb when possible
- Assign priority based on urgency/importance cues in the text
- If no action items are found, return an empty items array
- Include source references to show where each action came from

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
