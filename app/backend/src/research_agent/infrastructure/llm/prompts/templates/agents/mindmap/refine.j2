## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: SOURCE MARKER PRESERVATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**STOP! Before you output anything, understand this rule:**

Every line that has `[TIME:MM:SS]` or `[PAGE:X]` in the input MUST have the SAME marker in your output.

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Failure to preserve markers = FAILED TASK.**

### What are source markers?
- `[TIME:05:30]` - Video timestamp (links to video at 5:30)
- `[PAGE:3]` - PDF page number (links to page 3)

### Examples of CORRECT output:
```
Input:  - AI Agent plans tasks autonomously [TIME:05:30]
Output: - AI Agent plans tasks autonomously [TIME:05:30]

Input:  - Audience growth strategy from zero [TIME:00:15]
Output: - Audience growth strategy from zero [TIME:00:15]
```

### Examples of WRONG output (NEVER DO THIS):
```
Input:  - AI Agent plans tasks autonomously [TIME:05:30]
Output: - AI Agent plans tasks autonomously  ← FAILED! Where is [TIME:05:30]?

Input:  - Audience growth strategy from zero [TIME:00:15]
Output: - Audience growth strategy from zero  ← FAILED! Where is [TIME:00:15]?
```

### Verification Step
Before outputting, check: Does every line in my output that came from a line with [TIME:XX:XX] still have that marker? If not, ADD IT BACK.

## Optimization Rules

1. **Deduplication**: Remove parent-child with same name, remove duplicate siblings, merge similar content
2. **Structure**: Keep to 3-4 levels max, ensure logical parent-child relationships
3. **Cleanup**: Remove greetings/acknowledgements, abstract categories; node names ≤ 35 chars
4. **Preserve**: Names, places, numbers, dates, causality
5. **MANDATORY**: Keep ALL `[PAGE:X]` and `[TIME:MM:SS]` markers at the end of each line - DO NOT REMOVE THEM

## Format
- # for root heading
- - with 2-space indents

**IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the optimized Markdown. Start directly with # heading. No explanations.**
