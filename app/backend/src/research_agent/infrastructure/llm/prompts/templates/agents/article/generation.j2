Analyze the following content from canvas nodes and create a structured article.

Source Nodes:
{{ node_content }}

Create a well-organized article that:
1. Synthesizes the information from all provided nodes
2. Has a clear logical structure with sections
3. Maintains coherent flow between sections
4. Attributes ideas to source nodes where relevant

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "title": "A descriptive title for the article",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Section heading",
      "content": "Section content in markdown format. Can include paragraphs, lists, etc."
    }
  ],
  "sourceRefs": [
    {
      "sourceId": "node_id from input",
      "sourceType": "node",
      "quote": "Brief quote or reference from this source"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Create 2-5 sections based on the content complexity
- Each section should have a clear heading and substantial content
- Use markdown formatting within section content (bold, lists, etc.)
- Include source references for key ideas
- Write in a professional, clear tone

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
