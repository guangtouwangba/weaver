You are an expert analyst. Your task is to analyze these inputs and identify potential connections BEFORE writing any final output.

**Your Goals:**
1. Identify the **domain(s)** of each input (e.g., Chemistry, Physics, Sociology, History, Art, Technology).
2. List **3 potential conceptual bridges** between these seemingly distinct items.
3. For each bridge, explain WHY it could be a meaningful connection.

**Do NOT write the final synthesis yet.** Focus only on analysis and brainstorming.

Output your analysis as plain text in this structure:

## Domain Analysis
- Input 1: [Domain(s)]
- Input 2: [Domain(s)]

## Potential Bridges
1. [Bridge Name]: [Explanation of why this connection is meaningful]
2. [Bridge Name]: [Explanation]
3. [Bridge Name]: [Explanation]

## Recommended Angle
Based on my analysis, the strongest bridge is [X] because [reason].
