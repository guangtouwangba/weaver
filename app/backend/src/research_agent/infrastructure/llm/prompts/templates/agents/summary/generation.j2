Analyze the following document and create an executive summary.

Document Title: {{ title }}

Create a comprehensive yet concise executive summary that:
1. Captures the main theme and purpose of the document
2. Highlights the most important information
3. Identifies key findings with specific, actionable insights

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "summary": "A comprehensive 2-3 paragraph executive summary of the document. Focus on the main themes, key arguments, and important conclusions. Write in clear, professional language.",
  "keyFindings": [
    {
      "label": "Short category label (2-4 words, e.g., 'AI Adoption', 'Market Trends')",
      "content": "Specific finding or insight with relevant details or metrics"
    },
    {
      "label": "Another category label",
      "content": "Another specific finding"
    }
  ]
}
{% endraw %}

Guidelines:
- The summary should be 2-3 paragraphs, approximately 150-250 words
- Include 3-5 key findings
- Each key finding should have a brief label and a detailed content description
- Focus on actionable insights and concrete data when available
- Maintain a professional, analytical tone

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
