Convert this text into **structured knowledge notes**.

## Text Content
{{ content }}

{% include "_base/skills.j2" %}

## Core Principle

❌ Don't: List everything, follow original structure
✅ Do: Extract core ideas, reorganize logically

## Output Structure

### Layer 1: Core Points (5-10)
- Most important concepts/themes/ideas
- Concise phrase for each

### Layer 2: Elaboration
- Explanation of each core point
- Key definitions, methods, steps

### Layer 3: Supporting Details
- Specific cases, data, quotes
- Preserve key info (names, places, numbers, dates)

## Source Reference Rules
- Input text may contain source markers like `[PAGE:X]` or `[TIME:MM:SS]`
- When extracting points, you **MUST preserve** the most relevant source marker at the end
- If a point spans multiple sources, keep the primary source marker
- Example: "Core of investing is understanding future cash flow [PAGE:15]" or "AI Agent plans tasks autonomously [TIME:05:30]"

## Extraction Principles

1. **Keep specifics**: Names, companies, places, numbers, dates, quotes
2. **Show causality**: Cause → effect, problem → solution
3. **Distinguish importance**: Core ideas vs supporting details
4. **Remove noise**: Acknowledgements, greetings, repetition

## Format
- # for root heading (summarize theme)
- - with 2-space indent for hierarchy
- Keep to 3-4 levels
- Node names ≤ 35 characters

Output Markdown directly, no explanations:
