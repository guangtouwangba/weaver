## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: SOURCE MARKER PRESERVATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**STOP! Before you output anything, understand this rule:**

Every piece of content that has `[TIME:MM:SS]` or `[PAGE:X]` in the input MUST have the SAME marker in your output.

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Failure to preserve markers = FAILED TASK.**

### What are source markers?
- `[TIME:05:30]` - Video timestamp (links to video at 5:30)
- `[PAGE:3]` - PDF page number (links to page 3)

### Examples of CORRECT output:
```
Input text: AI Agent 自主规划任务 [TIME:05:30]
Output:     - AI Agent 自主规划任务 [TIME:05:30]

Input text: 零基础受众增长策略 [TIME:00:15]
Output:     - 零基础受众增长策略 [TIME:00:15]
```

### Examples of WRONG output (NEVER DO THIS):
```
Input text: AI Agent 自主规划任务 [TIME:05:30]
Output:     - AI Agent 自主规划任务  ← FAILED! Where is [TIME:05:30]?
```

### Verification Step
Before outputting, check: Does every line in my output that came from content with [TIME:XX:XX] still have that marker? If not, ADD IT BACK.

## Core Principle

❌ Don't: List everything, follow original structure
✅ Do: Extract core ideas, reorganize logically

## Output Structure

### Layer 1: Core Points (5-10)
- Most important concepts/themes/ideas
- Concise phrase for each

### Layer 2: Elaboration
- Explanation of each core point
- Key definitions, methods, steps

### Layer 3: Supporting Details
- Specific cases, data, quotes
- Preserve key info (names, places, numbers, dates)

## Source Reference Rules
- Input text contains source markers like `[PAGE:X]` or `[TIME:MM:SS]`
- When extracting points, you **MUST preserve** the most relevant source marker at the end of each line
- If a point spans multiple sources, keep the primary source marker
- **MANDATORY**: Every extracted point should retain its source marker - DO NOT REMOVE THEM

## Extraction Principles

1. **Keep specifics**: Names, companies, places, numbers, dates, quotes
2. **Show causality**: Cause → effect, problem → solution
3. **Distinguish importance**: Core ideas vs supporting details
4. **Remove noise**: Acknowledgements, greetings, repetition
5. **MANDATORY**: Keep ALL `[PAGE:X]` and `[TIME:MM:SS]` markers - NEVER DELETE THEM

## Format
- # for root heading (summarize theme)
- - with 2-space indent for hierarchy
- Keep to 3-4 levels
- Node names ≤ 35 characters
